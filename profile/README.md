The company practices *research*, *data* and **_scientific computing_** using modern computational power. We're currently creating something magical for the community!

## Organization Structure

One of the most crucial steps in the application industry is to determine a correct organizational structure to achieve optimal business solutions. There are two basic types of models - (I) *silo model* - a type where each team is aligned with a specific business function or domain, and (II) *system integrator* - a type where a team is developed by grouping people with similar skills. A bare minimal organization structure is defined as below:

<div align = "center">

```mermaid
graph TD;
  CEO --> COO;
  CEO --> CFO;

  CFO --> Accounts-Department;
  Accounts-Department --> Payroll-Teams;

  COO --> Audits-Department;
  CFO --> Audits-Department;

  Audits-Department --> Head:Data-Auditor;
  Audits-Department --> Head:Compliance-Officer;

  COO --> CMO;
  COO --> CTO;
  COO --> CIO;
  COO --> CHRO;
  COO --> CSBDO;

  CMO --> Head:Digital-Marketing;
  CMO --> Marketing-Director;

  CHRO --> Head:Relationships-Manager;

  CTO --> CDO;
  CDO --> CDS;

  CIO --> Head:IT-Department;
```

</div>

The elaborate structure and working of several departments may often overlap, however a general structure of the organization is developed. The in-line products are mostly developed using *open-source* software; thus, `CDO` and `CIO` work overlaps with managing a centralized repository.
