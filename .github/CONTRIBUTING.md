First and foremost, üôè thank you for considering to contribute to `neuralNOD`. We are currently
working on the following [projects/products](#void). The projects are mostly optimized and
custom built for internal usages. New members, or external contributors are requested to adhere to
the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and are requested to first discuss the changes via
an issue, or as directed by project owners.

The commit messages are open-ended and not much restricted, however
[best practices](https://gist.github.com/robertpainsi/b632364184e70900af4ab688decf6f53) are
mentioned for your reference. To get an overview of the project, read the [README](../README.md).

## Getting Started

To navigate our codebase with confidence, check the documentations :confetti_ball:. For more information on how we write our markdown files,
see [the GitHub Markdown reference](contributing/content-markup-reference.md) :sparkles:.

### Issues

If you spot a problem with any of the funtionalities/documentations then first [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a
related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/github/docs/issues/new/choose).

### Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a  build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment  variables,
   exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you 
   do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
